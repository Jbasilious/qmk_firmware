This is a fork of the [QMK keyboard firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) source code, from which I built the firmware I used for my personal mechanical keyboard build. <br>
I've added the keymap and layout files required for my keyboard design.<br>

The full build log and design can be seen on my [Website](https://basilious.ca/mechanical-keyboard-build/)
