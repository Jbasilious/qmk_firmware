This is a fork of QMK keyboard firmware, from which i built the firmware I used for my personal mechanical keyboard build. 
I've added the keymap and layout files required for my keyboard design.
The full buildlog and design can be seen on my [Website](https://basilious.ca/mechanical-keyboard-build/)
