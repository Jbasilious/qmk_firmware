These are the files for my keyboard design which can be seen on my [website](https://basilious.ca/mechanical-keyboard-build/). 

It essentially is a standard 75% layout (more compact Tenkeyless) with a numpad on the lefthand side. The design mentality for this is to create a keyboard which doesn't compromise on full size keyboard functionality, while allowing for the
alphanumerical keys to stay centered without moving the computer mouse far off to the side.
